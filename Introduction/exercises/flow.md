# Flow control exercises
Create a new Python script file, call it `flow.py`, that contains the following code:
```python
num_range = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```
Add code to the end of the file to fulfil the following tasks.
1. Create a for-loop that prints each of the members of `num_range`.
2. Modify your loop so that even numbers are skipped.
3. Use the `break` keyword to stop the loop when it reaches the element `7`.
