# Functions exercise
Create a new Python script file, call it `function.py`, that contains the following code:
```python
def foo(text):

    list_of_words = []
    return list_of_words
```
Modify the definition of the function `foo` above to fulfil the following tasks.1. If the input `text` is an empty string, return an empty list.
2. Split the text into words, using the `split` method, and store this in the `list_of_words` variable.
3. Filter out any words in `list_of_words` which have fewer than 3 characters.
4. Return what remains of `list_of_words`.
