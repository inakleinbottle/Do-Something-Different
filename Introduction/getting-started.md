# Getting started with Python
Python is a popular powerful programming language that is easy to learn. Python (currently) comes in two flavours: Python 2 and Python 3. Python 3 is the current version of Python, and Python 2 will not be supported beyond January 2020.

## Installing Python
There are many ways to install Python, depending on what system you use. The standard distribution of Python can be installed from the [Python website](https://python.org).

### Anaconda
Anaconda is an alternative distribution of Python geared towards scientific users. It comes with many common scientific packages pre-installed. It also provides several additional tools like Jupyter notebooks, the Spyder independent development environment, and an enhanced python console. Moreover, it has its own navigator for managing projects, packages, and launching tools. This is a useful tool for those who are not comfortable using the command line or who are using Windows.

## Editors
Python code can be written in any text editor or integrated development environment (IDE); popular choices on Linux and Mac include Vim and Emacs, although these editors have their own learning curve.
You may prefer to use an editor specifically designed for writing Python code.
The following are good choices.

### Idle
Idle is a Python terminal and editor that comes with the standard distribution of Python. (This being the main attraction.) It has features such as syntax highlighting and autocompletion, but it is not the most thrilling editor.

### Mu
Mu is a simple editor designed with beginner programmers in mind. It is free (open source) and comes with many great features, such as autocompletion and syntax highlighting out of the box. It can be downloaded from the website [codewith.mu](https://codewith.mu).


## Other places to find Python information
There are (of course) many Python guides, books, courses, and other sources of information. 
The official Python documentation, found at [docs.python.org](https://docs.python.org), contains a complete tutorial, which is an execellent introduction to the language. Also found in the official documentation are the [standard library reference](https://docs.python.org/3/library/) and [Python language reference](https://docs.python.org/3/reference).
