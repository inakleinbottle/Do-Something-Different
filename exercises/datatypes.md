# Datatypes exercise
Create a new Python script file, call it `datatypes.py` containing the following lines of code:
```python
a = 12
b = 5.
c = '17'
```
Add code to your script to fulfil each of the following tasks.
1. Print the sum and product of `a` and `b`, and the product of `a` with `c`. What is the type of the result in each case?
2. Use the `bin` function to print out the binary representation of `a`.
3. Use the `int` function to convert `b` into an integer, store the result in the variable `d`
4. Print the binary representation of `a * d`.
